* Be welcoming: as a principle, anyone should be able to contribute, regardless of previous experience or scope of contribution.


## How to Contribute

# :point_up: Reporting Issues
If you find a bug/inconsistency, proceed by filing an issue in the affected repository:

*[paratii-player/issues](https://github.com/Paratii-Video/paratii-player/issues) - anything related to the media player (this is our application’s main repo).

*[paratii-contracts/issues](https://github.com/Paratii-Video/paratii-contracts/issues) - issues related to Paratii’s family of core smart contracts.

*[wiki/issues](https://github.com/Paratii-Video/wiki/issues) - anything related to general architecture, incentive structures, specs and documentation.


# :bar_chart: Tests, Miscellaneous

If you see opportunities to improve test coverage, or envision an alternative       implementation of some code that may be advantageous, we are eager to hear about it. Being it minimal, please create a PR. If not, open an issue to discuss the approach and gather feedback.


# :wrench: Bug fixes

Report bugs using issues. Label these issues as `bugs`. Issues identified as a bug shall be labeled `bug`.

If you have a fix for a bug, create a fork, make a PR and refer to the issue number.

Ideally, you’d include a test that isolates the bug and verifies that it was fixed :)


# :bulb: New Features

To propose things a certain library is capable of accomplishing, describe the envisioned implementation in an issue, and label it `enhancement`. Issues that fall under this type will be labeled as such.

Project maintainers will do their best to look at proposal and engage in discussion as quickly and soundly as possible. It is recommended that you wait for some feedback before spending time/resources writing code for the envisioned implementation.


## Documentation and Translation

Documentation can fall behind when things are advancing fast. If you can’t find the documents you are looking for, or could be saved by a translation, fill an issue in [wiki/issues](https://github.com/Paratii-Video/wiki/issues) and we’ll do our best to help. Voluntary translations are of course more than welcomed.


## :dizzy: To make your contribution shine

*Descriptive commit messages with associated issues referenced by number.

*Code neatly under styling conventions.

*Test suite complete and passing.
