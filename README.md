## The Paratii Wiki

Paratii is an open source R&D lab. In our wiki we collect texts and ongoing research in various stages of maturity: [the wiki](https://github.com/Paratii-Video/wiki/wiki/1.-%F0%9F%8F%A0Home).

Most of our relevant research material eventually gets summarised in our [Medium](https://medium.com/paratii).

The [portal web app](https://portal.paratii.video/) is an early lab for playing with distribution and monetisation schemes upon IPFS and Ethereum. It's currently in alpha, running on a testnet.
