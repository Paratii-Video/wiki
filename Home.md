# Paratii Wiki

We believe [humans are essentially storytelling monkeys](http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-06630-1.html). That _video_ is a powerful medium for spreading stories + impacting people. And that its distribution shouldn't be oligarchically controlled, but rather aim for inclusiveness, cost-efficiency, and decentralisation of power.

Hence, we're building a video player. One that ties access to different open protocols for media storage and streaming via a single software client, while providing liquidity through an automated market maker and a native token, the [**PTI**](LINK : THE PARATII TOKEN). What does this mean? That Paratii's maturity will allow for content creators, watchers and media buyers to participate in video networks very much like they're used to, but **without any central for-profit entity taxing the value exchanges among them**. Basically:

* Users can watch low-latency videos streamed in p2p fashion directly in their browsers, and be accountable in a native token regarding specific contributions to the network and services consumed.
* Videomakers can "upload" content (paying for storage from their account's initial credits) and freely manipulate preferences as for their monetisation model of choice.
* Attention marketers (e.g. advertisers, media investors) can bid on media space via an order book, and verify audience measurements in a trustless manner.

## :mag_right: Overview
Paratii is an early stage endeavour and a socioeconomic experiment. Its aim is to deliver an embeddable application that interfaces with an underlying [DSN](https://filecoin.io/filecoin.pdf), manipulates (multiplexes) streams as required and displays content accordingly, without the end user ever needing to know what a blockchain is. See our [Roadmap](https://github.com/Paratii-Video/paratii-player/projects/1) for information on development milestones and timeline. A longer-term vision can be found [here](LINK ROADMAP 2).

Essential components for the materialisation of this vision are:

* [Paratii Player](https://github.com/Paratii-Video/paratii-player)
* [Paratii Core](https://github.com/Paratii-Video/paratii-contracts)
* Paratii Open RTB API (TBS)
* Additional modules (TBS)

The [Paratii Blueprint](https://github.com/Paratii-Video/paratii-player/wiki/Paratii-Blueprint) is a helpful resource for those seeking a high level overview of the system and the business case for its implementation.
