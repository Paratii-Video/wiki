# Flagging Content
Paratii will employ *token curated registries* to flag content as either offensive or illegal.

When someone registers a video, they will stake the video with a predetermined number of tokens. Whenver someone views the video, they will be given an opportunity to flag the video by staking tokens against the video for a set period of time after the video has been registered. If the video has been flagged, viewers will be notified after watching so they will know there is an increased incentive to mark the video as "flagged" or "unflaggged". Once that set amount of time has elapsed, half of all the tokens staked in the video (including those staked by the uploader) are redistributed to the side that stakes the most tokens. The other half is redistributed to everyone that voted for or against the video.  

# Playlists
Users can create playlists in a similar manner to flagging or unflagging videos. After watching a video, a user will be given the opportunity to stake the video within a playlist.
