# The Paratii Player

## Key Hierarchy
We will need a system for the Paratii Player to handle a user's ETH and Tokens. It would be both unwise from a user's perspective and a general security risk for the user to relinquish all control of their PTI and ETH to the Paratii Player. It would be perfectly reasonable, however, for a user to deposit some subset of those tokens into a shared wallet or an account from which they could reclaim their ETH and PTI or relaod their account balance with more ETH and PTI, and allowed the Paratii Player to spend tokens and ETH in accordance with the paratii contract.

In this sceario, it would be a good security practice to have a key heirarchy for users to spend their tokens through the paratii player. Users will have a master key they can use to unlock their paratii player wallet. This **spending** key can sign, validate, and invalidate **posting** keys used to cast votes on videos for ratings, flagging and moderation.
